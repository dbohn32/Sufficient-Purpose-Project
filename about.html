            <p>
                Sufficient Purpose was created by women for women and children. This is a community service program that is available through the donation process. We accept gently used clothing and shoes for women and children. 

Along with clothes we ask for accessories. The purpose is to give to women and children in need who cant afford to purchase new clothing. We give away all the items that have been donated to those in need at absolutely no cost to the giver or the receiver.  

We aim to help women who need this service to better present themselves for interviews, outings and children's programs. Being a mother often times means going without for you or the child. This service is here to help fill one of the areas that are often in lack. And this need can be met with your donations !

Donations can be dropped off to one of our local donation sites or can be picked up. This service is held in the South Bend Indiana. As we continue to grow and partner we hope to become a global lighthouse for women and children through many different ways. We ask that you consider us when cleaning out your closets and dresser drawers. As always we appreciate the continued support and all the generous donations. Thank you !
            </p>
